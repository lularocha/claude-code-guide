# Claude Skills

## What They Are

**Skills** are folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources (with a `SKILL.md` file) that Claude automatically loads when relevant to your task.

---

## Key Points

- Transform Claude from general-purpose to specialized for specific tasks
- Pre-built skills exist for documents (PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF)
- Custom skills: create a folder with `SKILL.md` and Claude discovers them automatically
- Progressive disclosure: loads only what's needed, keeping context efficient
- Released as an **open standard** (December 2025) - adopted by OpenAI too

## How Skills Work

At its simplest, a skill is a directory that contains a `SKILL.md` file. This file must start with YAML frontmatter containing required metadata: `name` and `description`.

At startup, Claude pre-loads the name and description of every installed skill. The description field is how Claude decides whether to use your Skill.

### Good Description

A good description answers two questions:
1. **What does this Skill do?** - List the specific capabilities
2. **When should Claude use it?** - Include trigger terms users would mention

### Best Practices

- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines for optimal performance
- If content exceeds this, split detailed reference material into separate files
- Claude discovers supporting files through links in your `SKILL.md`

### Read PDF Example

Here's a simple example of what working with PDFs looks like using the pypdf library:

```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

# Read a PDF
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
print(f"Pages: {len(reader.pages)}")

# Extract text
text = ""
for page in reader.pages:
    text += page.extract_text()
```
