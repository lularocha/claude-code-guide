# Prompt Basics

## Best Practices for Beginners

Top recommendations for effective prompting that can be used for any AI:

- **Be specific** — Specific instructions work better than vague requests. Tell exactly what you want to see in the output.
- **Provide context and examples** — Explain why you need something and show examples of what good output looks like (few-shot prompting). Use visuals like screenshots when possible.
- **Tell what to do, not what to avoid** — Frame instructions positively ("Write in flowing prose") rather than negatively ("Don't use bullet points").
