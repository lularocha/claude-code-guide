# Prompts

## Best Practices for Beginners

Top recommendations for effective prompting that can be used for any AI:

<h3 style="color: #f60; font-size: 1.5rem;">Be specific</h3>
Specific instructions work better than vague requests. Tell exactly what you want to see in the output.

<h3 style="color: #f60; font-size: 1.5rem;">Provide context and examples</h3>
Explain why you need something and show examples of what good output looks like. Use visuals like screenshots when possible.

<h3 style="color: #f60; font-size: 1.5rem;">Tell what to do, not what to avoid</h3>
Frame instructions positively ("Write in flowing prose") rather than negatively ("Don't use bullet points").
